## Reading Guide

This is an explanation on how to read my portfolio. First of al I have made a section for [The Group Project](#group-project). Here I will explain what app we are making and how we came up with our idea's. After that I will explain what [my personal stake](#my-work) was in the project and what I have done and some examples of my work. Behind that we have another module were I explain what I have done for each [Learning Outcome](#learning-outcomes) and what I think would be an appropriate 'rating' to give myself for that LO.

### Group Project

At Mentis, our group has been working on a mobile app in Flutter called Overload, designed to help people understand what individuals with overstimulation disorders such as ADHD, autism, and brain injuries experience. We achieve this through a VR experience combined with 8D audio to provide an immersive sense of what these individuals go through and offer tips and suggestions on how to assist them.

We received the subject of overstimulation from a third-party company, Studio Krom, via Fontys. We had the freedom to create anything related to overstimulation. After extensive research and brainstorming, we developed the Overload concept. We presented it to Studio Krom, and they were very positive about the idea. So thats how we came up with Overload.

## My work

In the group project I have done my fair share of work for the group. We have put all of our work in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Sprints-8742edc4e19c4cf58ed44dba1c23ccd0) but I would like you to go through ever LO separately where I explain for each LO what I have done.

## Learning Outcomes

Here I breakdown every learning outcome and explain what I have done for that particular learning outcome and what I think would be an appropriate 'rating' to give myself for that LO.
