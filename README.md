## Individual Assignments

### Tech Case Week 1-3

In the first three weeks of this semester we were tasked to make an technical Flutter app. My assignment was to make an [A battery app for a global audience](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13675/pages/tech-case-9-a-battery-app-for-a-global-audience?module_item_id=1061642). This was a not really a big challenge, but it was a good start for learning how Flutter works. To find more info about my app click [here](/documentation/tech-case-9.md)
