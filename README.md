## Reading Guide

This is an explaination on you to read my portfolio. in [Individual Assignments](#individual-assignments) I touch on the techcase mostly the technical workings of it. In [Duo Assignments](#duo-assignments) Is a link to [our shared repository](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/tree/main). There you can find the Duo Case application and the [Research on Mood Prediction](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/blob/main/documentation/research/mood-predictor.md) and [UX Testing](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/blob/main/documentation/research/mood-predictor-ux-testing.md). Finally, there's a section for the [Learning Outcomes](#learning-outcomes) where I discuss every learning outcome. Explaining what I have done for that particular learning outcome and what I think would be an appropriate 'rating' to give myself for that LO.
