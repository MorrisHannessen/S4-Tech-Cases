# Professional Skills

## Objective

Showcase your professional development as a mobile developer through authentic, professional IT tasks, where both the process and the result are visible.

## Proof of Concept

My professional Skills have certainly improved over these weeks. I think my feedpulse is the best way to proof that. I have asked for more feedback and handled those feedback conversations in an professional manner. And I have noticed that i have gained more confidence in going to my teacher and showing them my work/progression I have made.

Working with my duo partner Joris was always done in an Professional manner and I think worked really well. We always let each other know when something was up. And if there was a problem we were able to handle that in a Professional way.

While looking for an internship I have had a few conversation with real companies and found out how important Professional Skills are and how I have grow in them.

## Rating

I find it hard to rate myself on my Professional Skills but I think that i would give myself an Proficient. I have gotten a lot better at them but there is still a lot to learn and improve on!
