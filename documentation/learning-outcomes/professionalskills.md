# Professional Skills

## Objective

Showcase your professional development as a mobile developer through authentic, professional IT tasks, where both the process and the result are visible.

## Proof of Concept

My professional skills have further improved through this experience. I frequently communicated in English as I was part of a group with international students, necessitating the use of a common language. At the start of the project, we had different opinions on how to communicate with each other. However, we addressed this issue during the retrospective. We made some changes to our communication methods and the timing of our stand-ups, and we established firm rules regarding attendance. After these adjustments, we saw significant improvements in our professional interactions within the group.

Our communication with the stakeholder, Studio Krom, was also seamless. We always had a sprint presentation where we reviewed our accomplishments, discussed how things went, and outlined the scope for the next sprint. We consistently received compliments for our honesty in reviews and our well-defined and factual sprint scopes.

## Rating

I find it hard to rate myself on my Professional Skills but I think that i would give myself an Proficient. I have gotten a lot better at them but there is still a lot to learn and improve on!
