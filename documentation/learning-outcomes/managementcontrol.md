# Management & Control

## Objective

Apply techniques continuously to manage the development process and assure its quality, maintaining direct communication with all stakeholders.

## Proof of Concept

My Management & Control is all I think in order. I have a good communication with my stakeholders(teachers). Management wise I have always kept an organized Github for managing my files and have done the same with my group project. We have set an clear structure on how we would manage our text document and files.
