# Management & Control

## Objective

Apply techniques continuously to manage the development process and assure its quality, maintaining direct communication with all stakeholders.

## Proof of Concept

In this group project, we used Scrum. At first, this was quite challenging because we had three media students from a different course who hadn't worked with Scrum before. So, Joris and I had to explain how everything worked and how we were going to approach the project. We had already worked with Scrum for a whole semester in our third-semester software course. It was understandably a bit difficult for the media students to change the way they usually worked, but they have significantly improved and adapted well.

For our tools, we used [Jira](https://io-dev.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/IPSM4/boards/5) for Scrum management, [GitHub](https://github.com/StudioKrom-SmartMobile-2024/frontend) for software file management, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Sprints-8742edc4e19c4cf58ed44dba1c23ccd0) for documentation and PDFs, and Discord as our primary communication tool. Additionally, we had a WhatsApp group for minor updates, such as if someone couldn't make it to a sprint. We also had a Slack channel set up by our stakeholders, although it wasn't used very often.

For Joris and me, working with Scrum was quite nice since we were already familiar and experienced with it. We were actually quite pleased when we found out we needed to use Scrum. However, the three media students had never worked with sprints before, so it was quite challenging to explain everything to them at first. The stand-ups, which are essential in Scrum, were often attended only by Joris, Desislava, and me. After the first sprint, things started to improve, and Maksim and Maksymilian began attending regularly, which greatly improved communication.

## Rating

I think i will give myself an Advanced for this LO. Me and Joris had to put in a lot of effort to get everything working so thats why I think that.
