# Advice

## Objective

Based on relevant analysis, you advice on suitable user interaction and technological design, improvement of designs, research and/or methodology.

## Clarification

- **Iterative Work**: Emphasize an iterative approach to work, incorporating outcomes of user tests and creating Proof of Concepts (POCs).
- **Feedback Processing**: Actively incorporate the feedback received on your work to enhance your advice.
- **Relevant Analysis**: Use the outcomes of the analysis phase conducted by you, your team, or other developers as a foundation for your advice.

## Proof of Concept

The first phase of the project involved a significant amount of research. We were only given the subject of overstimulation by the stakeholders, so we began with some initial research to understand what overstimulation actually is. Following this, we brainstormed basic concepts with the entire group. My personal research is linked below. Although it is somewhat less than the last assessment, we had three media students who were much better at delivering quality analysis. I still conducted some analysis, but since we were responsible for all the programming for the project, we asked Marcel if it was acceptable to divide the work this way, and he agreed.
