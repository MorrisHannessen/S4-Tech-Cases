# Design

## Objective

You translate concepts into user friendly designs and validate these designs through user tested iterations.

## Proof of Concept

I haven't done much more designing since the last assessment. I was in a group with three media students and two software students (including myself). We asked Marcel if it was acceptable for Joris and me to handle all the coding while the media students focused on the design and iterations/tests. He approved this arrangement, so I didn't do much designing. Of course, I provided feedback and assisted when they encountered difficulties. I also contributed to the wireframing, offering technical input on how to incorporate the VR page into the design.
