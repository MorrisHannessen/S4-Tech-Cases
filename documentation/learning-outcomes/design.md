# Design

## Objective

You translate concepts into user friendly designs and validate these designs through user tested iterations.

## Proof of Concept

I haven't done much more designing since the last assesment. Thats I was in a group with 3 media student and 2 software student(whitch i am). So we asked to Marcel if it was okay if Joris and me did all the coding and the media student made the design and irriations/tests. And he said that it was fine so I didn't do much designing. I offcourse gave my feedback and tried to help if the couldn't figure it out. I helped a bit with the wireframing because it needed some technical input on how to put the VR page in a design.
