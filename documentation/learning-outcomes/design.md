# Design

## Objective

You translate concepts into user friendly designs and validate these designs through user tested iterations.

## Proof of Concept

To show you my progress I have made on this LO you can go to [our UX testing for design](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/blob/main/documentation/research/mood-predictor-ux-testing.md). We also have done personal UX testing with classmates and our teacher Erik.

And this is how our final design was after our testing:

## Rating

I would give me for this LO an Advanced. Because we did a lot of testing, we asked Erik for feedback on our design many times and had 2 great feedback smileys in a row.
