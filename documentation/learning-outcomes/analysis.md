# Analysis

## Objective

You show you can convert a problem or opportunity into multiple smart mobile concepts based on thorough analysis.

## Clarification

- **Research Methods**: Utilize common research methods, such as the frameworks, to analyze problems, market trends, and relevant stakeholder interests.
- **Feedback Processing**: Incorporate the feedback received on your work to refine and improve your analysis and concepts.

## Proof of Concept

The first phase of the project involved a significant amount of research. We were only given the subject of overstimulation by the stakeholders, so we began with some initial research to understand what overstimulation actually is. Following this, we brainstormed basic concepts with the entire group. My personal research is linked below. Although it is somewhat less than the last assessment, we had three media students who were much better at delivering quality analysis. I still conducted some analysis, but since we were responsible for all the programming for the project, we asked Marcel if it was acceptable to divide the work this way, and he agreed.
