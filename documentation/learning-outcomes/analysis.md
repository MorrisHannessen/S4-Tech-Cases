# Analysis

## Objective

You show you can convert a problem or opportunity into multiple smart mobile concepts based on thorough analysis.

## Clarification

- **Research Methods**: Utilize common research methods, such as the frameworks, to analyze problems, market trends, and relevant stakeholder interests.
- **Feedback Processing**: Incorporate the feedback received on your work to refine and improve your analysis and concepts.

## Proof of Concept

For the proof of this LO i would suggests to click [here](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/blob/main/documentation/research/mood-predictor.md) that link will take you to our shared repository. There you can find that we converted our problem:
`People want to feel good all the time. But what situations trigger a person to feel good?`
into multiple concepts trough research and analysis and iterating on our idea's

## Rating

We put a lot of effort in making a lot of concepts before we even started designing, and we did a lot of research/analysis for each concept we created so I would put myself at least at Proficient. We also asked a lot of feedback from Erik. What at the end helped a lot with making the concepts and gave us a better idea on how to go from a simple problem to smart mobile concepts.
