## Rating

We put a lot of effort in making a lot of concepts before we even started designing, and we did a lot of research/analysis for each concept we created so I would put myself at least at Proficient. We also asked a lot of feedback from Erik. What at the end helped a lot with making the concepts and gave us a better idea on how to go from a simple problem to smart mobile concepts.
