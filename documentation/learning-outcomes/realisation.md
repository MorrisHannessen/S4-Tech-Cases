# Realisation

## Objective

Implement high-quality applications using both client-side and server-side programming languages, while leveraging relevant mobile hardware.

## Proof of Concept

Joris and I handled all of the programming for this project, so I have a lot to discuss. Initially, I conducted technical research for the project, focusing on haptic feedback. You can find my technical documentation for the plugin I used [here](https://www.notion.so/Technical-Research-Demos-481ede4b614c4195874ad1d97018eb30). I also created a demo application to demonstrate how to use this plugin in the main application, which can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/StudioKrom-SmartMobile-2024/frontend/tree/main) under the "demos" folder and then "haptic_feedback_testing_demo."

For our VR experience within the application, we also needed technical research. The documentation for that research can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/VR-plugin-64ed2b141c6340f99adb928486a23e0c), and the demo we created is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StudioKrom-SmartMobile-2024/frontend/tree/main) under "demos" and then "vr_demo." We began building our full VR experience within that demo because it was easier to develop it in a separate project before integrating it into our main application.

After the design was completed, we started building our main Flutter application. We began this phase four days ago, and Joris and I have nearly completed the entire application. This rapid progress was possible due to our preparatory work, like finishing the VR component beforehand. The complete application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StudioKrom-SmartMobile-2024/frontend/tree/main) under "overload." I have become very proficient and efficient in working with Flutter, quickly building apps and widgets. All of our widgets are written dynamically, allowing us to change the entire look by just adjusting a few variables. We consistently review each other's code and provide constructive criticism to maintain a high-quality standard.

For this LO I would give myself an Proficient. We set an high-quality standard for our code and work quickly and effient. Even after the design fase to alot longer then expected
