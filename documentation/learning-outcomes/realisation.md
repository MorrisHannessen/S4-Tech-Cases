# Realisation

## Objective

Implement high-quality applications using both client-side and server-side programming languages, while leveraging relevant mobile hardware.

## High Quality

- Ensure applications meet both functional and non-functional requirements by considering security, privacy, code quality, and maintainability through testing.

## Applications

- Develop Proof of Concepts and complex prototypes that include a tested User Experience (UX), a User Interface (UI), industry-standard programming, and a functional backend.

## Programming Languages

- Use both native (Kotlin and Swift) and hybrid languages/frameworks (PWA, Flutter) based on research and personal experience.

## Server Side

- Implement or utilize a backend solution that enables mobile application communication.

## Hardware

- Utilize internal or external sensors to enhance the mobile experience.

## Feedback Processing

- Incorporate feedback received on your work throughout the development process.
