# Realisation

## Objective

Implement high-quality applications using both client-side and server-side programming languages, while leveraging relevant mobile hardware.

## Proof of Concept

For this I will link to [my techcase document](/documentation/tech-case-17.md). 
There I have my technical documentation on my Realisation of my application.

## Rating

For this LO I would give myself an Proficient. I have made the techcase with good feedback from Marcel:

I have made extra features but I don't find that enough for a higher rating.
